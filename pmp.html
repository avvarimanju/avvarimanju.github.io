    <h1>PMP Exam Tips – Eliminate the Wrong Choices</h1>

    <p>Keywords like <span class="red">"instruct," "order," "push," "mandate,"</span> and <span class="red">"warning"</span> are strong indicators of incorrect or less desirable actions a project manager should take when interacting with team members.</p>

    <h2>Why these keywords usually point to wrong answers:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>PMP emphasizes <span class="green">leadership and collaboration, not authoritarian control</span>.</li>
        <li><span class="green">Effective project management</span> builds trust and a positive team environment.</li>
        <li>The PMBOK Guide promotes <span class="blue">communication, negotiation, and conflict resolution</span>.</li>
        <li><span class="green">Situational leadership</span> is key — understanding the team's needs is more valued than command-and-control behavior.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>How to use this to eliminate wrong options:</h2>
    <p>If you see choices with these red-flag words, avoid them and look for options that promote collaboration and understanding:</p>

    <h3>Look for better alternatives that emphasize:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Communication:</strong> <span class="green">"Communicate the expectation," "Discuss the issue," "Clarify the requirements."</span></li>
        <li><strong>Collaboration:</strong> <span class="green">"Work with the team," "Facilitate a discussion," "Involve the team in finding a solution."</span></li>
        <li><strong>Support:</strong> <span class="green">"Provide guidance," "Offer resources," "Help the team member understand."</span></li>
        <li><strong>Escalation:</strong> <span class="green">"Escalate to the appropriate authority," "Inform the sponsor."</span></li>
        <li><strong>Performance Management:</strong> <span class="green">"Provide feedback," "Address issues per the project management plan."</span></li>
    </ul>

    <p>This mindset will help you pick the best answers and pass the PMP exam with confidence!</p>
